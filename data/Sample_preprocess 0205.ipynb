       "'\"Dr. Anderson explained in detail my options for the repair on my tooth. In the end, I received great results.\"\\nHad an implant done and it was painless. I couldn\\'t afford it so he put me on a payment plan. I\\'m pleased with the service. Great doctor\\nDo not go to this dentist office they scam people and do not pay there bills.  We snow plowed for them and when the season was over they would not pay us.  This is just to let you know what type of dentist your dealing with.\\nVery thoughtful Dr.  Communicates/bedside manners great.\\nWould continue to see Dr.  Larsen however his front desk secretary is something else it saddens me to have to give my money to someone else \\nDr. Acres and his staff are an exceptionally professional and caring team of health professionals that I highly recommend. \\n\"After smiling and shaking my hand he was just cold. I was basically ordered where to sit because I was too slow for him I guess. Didn\\'t ask me how I was or try to get to know me in the least. I\\'m used to friendly dentists who try to work a little humanity into a visit but he must see people as just financial resources, oh maybe I didn\\'t rate any real courtesy because he wasn\\'t making much off me the day I was there .  Explained my dental problems well enough, I think, but he really didn\\'t want me to say ANYTHING, tried to interrupt if I had a question. Walked off like he was God\\'s gift after he was done talking about what work my teeth needed. He\\'s practicing now with Progressive Dentistry.  I was totally turned off, and stunned. I wouldn\\'t go back to see him if he was the last dentist on the planet. His dental hygienist was wonderful. I have nothing bad to say about her or my teeth cleaning experience, but Dr. Johnson needs charm lessons. \"\\n\"There are three doctors, I\\'ve seen (Dr Sara, Dr Aaron) in this office and are good.  They have newer equipment yet keep their prices reasonable for those of us with no insurance.  The staff is friendly and knowledgable. \"\\n\"Dr. Lee is the best dentist I have seen in my life hands down! His staff is friendly and very helpful,  love this office.\"\\nVery clean office.  Very modern.  Staff is extremely friendly. \\n\"Dr. Lee was wonderful, he did a root canal on me and it was pain free. His office is clean and modern. The staff was awesome they treated well. I\\'m telling all my friends and family about Dr. Lee and his wonderful staff.\"\\n\"This office is very clean, modern, the staff is wonderful!  Dr. Lee is very nice and really cares about his patients. \"\\nKudos to Dr. Aaron Lee and his wonderful staff!!! Dr. Aaron Lee was kind and gentle and actually performed the cleaning himself; which I appreciated him taking his time to do that task.  Thanks Doc for showing me how much you cared about me!  Dr. Lee\\'s office staff were very professional and courtesy to me and my sweetheart on our appointments; I couldn\\'t ask for more care and understanding.  I am no stranger to a dentist chair...and I appreciate this doctor and his staff because they made me feel like I was part of their family; even-thou this was my first visit.  I also saw how kind the front desk staff assisted others when I was in their lobby; again showing professionalism and gentle genuine concern.  Great experience all around for me and sweetheart.  \\n\"Great dentist.  Takes time to explain what is going on.  Very willing to answer questions.  Very little pain.  Good \"\"bed side manner.\"\"  Great job on a crown and a bridge.\"\\n\"He\\'s a great dentist, always ensuring you are comfortable. He has a great sense of humor, and he has a lot of patience, especially with people like me who ask too many questions.\"\\nDr. Mangum was very gentle and caring.  Great dentist. \\n\"Dr Aaron Rosen couldn\\'t have been less professional.  I wouldn\\'t send my worst enemy to him for dental work .  His chair side manor was that of a child.  Pouting , rolling his eyes , throwing his arms up when I asked simple questions related to my dental work .   Possibly he didn\\'t have an answer ??  I\\'ll never know.  He started a dental procedure and refused to finish!  Claiming I refused treatment which is 100% a lie!  He basically robbed me of 3000$.   He was polite and put on quite a show right up until he received my money.  There are to many qualified dentists out there do yourself a favor and use ANYONE else !!  I wish I had   \"\\n\"Words can\\'t describe how terrible my experience under dr Aaron Rosen\\'s care was, he\\'s evil  \"\\nMy daughter had jaw surgery and the pre-op and post-op bedside manner was above and beyond my expectations\\n\"I am an extremely fearful patient, I was referred to Dr Pokorny for a minor procedure with that in mind.  He and his staff (Rochester Hills office) were wonderful and helped me feel comfortable.  During the initial consultation, Dr Pokorny took his time to explain the procedure, recovery process and options.  He took the time to speak with me prior to beginning the procedure, to make sure I was comfortable and did not have additional questions or concerns.  He spoke to me throughout the procedure and followed up in the evening by phone.  Not only is he a skilled surgeon, but he cares about his patients.   A much different, better experience from the oral surgeons we used in the past for our sons.   \"\\nI really like going to his office & I\\'m usually a huge baby when it comes to the dentist but very caring & friendly staff. i also like how you can tell they honestly care.\\n\"I took my three your old son to see Dr. Pokorny last week for a minor surgical procedure and he did an outstanding job.  Later that day, one of the nurses called to follow up and make sure that everything was OK.  That evening (and a week later), the doctor himself, called to check up on my son.  A very highly skilled and professional surgeon.\\n\\nThe best part was how he was able to deal with a three year old.  OUTSTANDING!  Not only is my son not afraid of the dentist, like most kids, he\\'s been asking me all week when he can go back and see Dr. Aaron.  How is that for bedside manner. \\n\\nThanks for everything.\"\\n\"He treated me like more like a family member than a patient. He was so gentle I hardly felt anything, and did not believe it when they said they were done pulling my tooth. I hope I never have to get another tooth pulled, but if I do I would never go anywhere else!\"\\n\"Do not go and see this dentist.  Very unprofessional and he didn\\'t seem to have the appropriate level of knowledge. He became defensive when I began questioning his opinion.  I immediately left his office and scheduled a follow-up with a dentist with more years of experience. Without telling him what Dr. Pokorny told me, this dentist recommended the complete opposite. \"\\nHonest\\nI really thought the dentist was nice and concerning. His office was very nice and comfortable with all the newest technology able to make the paitent feel comfortable. The staff was very kind and caring. This dentist is very good and I would defiantly go to them again. \\nAwesome staff and doctor. They are great with my kids and explained everything very well. I highly recommend them.\\nVery kind office. They are honest and explain well what is going on!\\n\"Doctor Neale is efficient and kind.  He treats his patients well.  His staff in blackwell, is great.  Just recently moved to Blackwell, Oklahoma and doing a great job.  Gentle with my family and that means a lot.\"\\nI highly recommend Dr. Aaron Park--he is extremely knowledgable of all aspects of dentistry and oral surgery. What is most impressive is he explains what options are available in a very concise way. Dr. Park and all of his staff are very caring and also follow up to see if you have any questions or concerns.\\nI have seen Dr Pieper for about 8 years..He is one of the kindest and most gentle dentist. and he does exceptional work.\\n\"Dr. Jensen is the most easy going, nicest dentist I have ever encountered.  Very personable bedside manner.  He impressed me as really smart and highly skilled at what he does.  I would recommend him to anyone!  \"\\nDr Oge is awesome\\nLove Dr. Oge.  He is so gentle.\\nOne of a kind dentist. He cares and stands behind his treatment. I will be recommending this dentist. Office Manager Travis runs a well ran business.\\nCaring dentist and staff.  Attention to detail.  Excellent work performed.  \\nYou have changed our whole family to Dr. Shertzer. It is a family friendly clean professional atmosphere that takes the tension out of having to visit the dentist\\nbest dentist I Have been to.\\nMy kids and I love Dr payne and his whole staff. We have been seeing him for 5 years now and will definitely  remain with his office. Everyone else is so caring and kind\\n\"A very clean and comfortable office with great staff.  Dr. Payne is a highly professional dentist giving great quality dental care, affordable rates, and cares about his patients receiving best dental treatment. \"\\nI\\'ve been a patient of Dr. Payne for years and have had nothing but great experiences each time. He cares about his patients and his office staff is always friendly and professional. I would absolutely recommend Dr. Payne to anyone for they\\'re dental care. ddd\\n\"Dr. Payne is the kindest, most gentle, honest dentist I have ever been to. He cares about his patients and has our best interests in mind.  I have received great care from his entire office! They are friendly and I highly recommend Dr. Payne!\"\\n\"Dr. Payne is the best dentist! He is kind, courteous, and honest.  He takes time to give you the best care possible.  His hygienist gets my teeth very clean!  His staff is always friendly and easy to work with.  He has been my dentist for 10 years and I\\'ve never had a complaint!\"\\n\"My family has been going to Dr. Payne for years. He is always honest and will do the best for you. He is the only dentist that I have absolutely not had any pain from shots for numbness and has always been courteous. Hey, he does fantastic work, what more can I say? \\n\\n. \"\\n\"I had an emergency dental issue...my regular dentist didn\\'t even return my call( it was a holiday weekend...but he WAS supposed to be on call)..so I saw a magazine ad for Dr Sauer. Within 10 minutes he returned my call( at nighttime)... He had me come in the next morning ON A SUNDAY!   He numbed me up and gave me a temporary \"\"fix\"\" until I could get back in for a root canal. Needless to say, I WILL be a new client of his!!!\"\\n\"The office is clean and not bad. But the staffs aren\\'t nice at all. If you didn\\'t cancel your appointment in the timely manner, they will force you to leave and charge fee and refuse to release medical record. The online appointment calendar can only confirm the appointment and can\\'t change/update. Highly not recommend for this dentist at all. \"\\ngreat dentist! Highly recommended\\nLOVE MY DENTAL VISITS!!\\n\"Ripe off dentist, I had never paid to go to the dentist more than the co-pay,. They dont tell you the truth about the procedures and then you just get the statement on the mail for things that you didnt even know about them!  they pretend to be too nice and caring. Ripe off, never going back again! \"\\nDr. Slavsky is the best dentist I have ever had. He does not try to upsale you on work you do not need as some othere dentists will do.\\nDr Nolan was terrible. He had poor bedside manner and gave me a raging gum infection for invasive work I didn\\'t even need done. Beware of this dentist\\n\"Dr Nolan is OK, BUT the staff are so rude and unprofessional. \"\\nDr Unterbrink\\'s office & practice provides exceptional service. I got my wisdom teeth extracted. Dr Unterbrink provided instructions and cell phone number in case any issues occurred after hours.\\n\"i just want you to know that Dr. Nagelblatt\\'s demeanor is just wonderful, he is very patient and kind and listens to all my problems. He is a very pleasant touch and there is never any pain.\"\\nAmazing office and experience\\nI cannot express enough gratitude to Dr. Taff for the treatment I received while my own dentist was out of town.  He helped me through a gum infection which was resistant to the usual antibiotic by prescribing one which took immediate effect.  Then my temporary crown broke in half a week later (I advise against eating Grapenuts for breakfast with a temporary) which he was able to salvage and repair.  His office is clean and professional; his staff is lovely.  I feel very fortunate at having been referred to this office by my nurse friend.\\nNever been happier with a dentist\\nVery little pain\\nI went in for an emergency.  I now won\\'t go anywhere else.  My wife was very pleased by Dr. Walkers attention to every one of her worries.\\nDr Walker\\'s attention to detail is unlike any other dentist I have ever seen. My entire family sees him. Recommend highly\\nGreat with my 5 years old checkup. Our family dentist for several years. Highly recommend. \\n\"Loved the staff! They were very caring, and made me feel comfortable. \"\\n\"Dr. Rapps was very attentive, caring, and focused, with great precision and expertise. \"\\nHis bedside manner is excellent and his skills as a clinician are superior.\\nFantastic professional\\nExcellent in all aspects of my care\\nComprehensive dental care at its finest. :-)\\nI have seen both Dr. Shaftel and Jordan in their office. Both are great people and doc tors. Recommend to anyone in need of a dentist.\\nHis commitment to excellence is unrivaled. Wonderful person and doctor\\nVery good with my kids. He knows exactly what to say to ease their fears. You can tell he has kids of his own.\\nVery impressed with this dental office. Explained my teeth in terms I could understand and put together a reasonable treatment series to get my teeth healthy.\\nI have never liked going to a dentist however I do not mind with this dentist. My kids are actually excited when they are told they have an appointment. The staff is wonderful.\\n\"I was referred by my uncle and I saw in the first 10 minutes why he recommended this doctor.  The office was friendly, informative, and gentle. I did not wait more than 5 minutes in the waiting room. Office was clean and modern. I will be returning again for my next checkup! \"\\nPain free root canal. I like that he called to check on me. A Very satisfied patient.\\nI have been seeing my previous dentist from the time I was 5 until he retired a year ago. I went to vita and was surprised how much dentistry advanced during that time I was seeing my former dentist. Dr. Shaftel had many high tech gadgets which made my visit much more comfortable and informative. Very cool.\\nDr. Shaftel is a caring and very professional dentist. I always feel welcomed and cared for when I am at his practice. Refreshing change from what I expect with dental procedures.\\n\"The office staff was friendly and high tech. Hygienist was gentle and informative. Doctor gave me the most thorough dental exam I have ever had. He spent extra time reviewing what caused my problems, how he needs to fix them, and how to prevent them in the future. I was surprised my previous dentist never went into this much depth about my oral care. \"\\nI receive the best care from Dr. Studer at Advanced Dental Professionals.\\nI am so grateful that I have found Dr. Studer as a dentist ever since my move to Rapid City. I definitely plan on continuing to use his dental expertise.\\n\"Dr Onan is an excellent dentist in the Faculty Practice Clinic at OU Dental School. She ordered a thorough set of xrays, not just the bite-wings. I needed to have amalgam fillings removed due to age and small cavities. It took several appointments. I experienced very little pain from the procedures. Each visit took over an hour to complete. It was a pleasant experience as she occasionally sings along with the \"\"oldies\"\" music then laughs at herself when she goes off-key. She has a great sense of humor and bedside manner. I highly recommend her.\"\\nI been going to Dr Orlansky for many years he\\'s the best he has worked wonders with my teeth\\n\"I was very nervous about this visit but I didn\\'t have to be. Dr. Vaughn worked on  my teeth for about one hour, maybe a little longer, and I never had any pain at all!  He is an excellent  doctor.\"\\nDr. Al-Harazneh is excellent! I\\'m very happy that I found a dentist that who\\'s very honest and caring. I\\'m very thankful that he was able to save my tooth. Because of him people are always complementing my beautiful smile. He\\'s he best!\\nThe best dentist! I highly recommend him!\\nStaff was great \\n\"I have chronic Fibromyalgia...so I hurt all the time anyway.  When I start to have tooth pain, I begin to fear and tremble at the thought of dental pain.  I also have 3 bulging disks in my neck, and the dentist chair itself gives me severe neck headaches. Hence, I hate dentists.  Well, I had a too I needed fixed, hadn\\'t been to the dentist in a while, and finally went.  Dr. Wagner was there and I had never had him before.  His gentle smile is very calming, He has a genuine concern for your comfort level.  If you can\\'t have the chair back flat enough because it hurts, he\\'ll sit the chair up and re-position himself. He explains everything he is going to do before he does it, he shows you your x-rays and why you need done what he has to do and most importantly, continues to stop and ask if you\\'re okay and if its okay to proceed.  He is the gentlest dentist I\\'ve ever had administering the Novocaine...you hardly feel it.  He literally puts you first!  You are a person to him..not just \"\"next in line\"\".  He even had a cancellation at one point in time and asked me if I\\'d want him to continue working on as many as he could get done in that time frame as he knows, me being bed-bound, its hard to get out and to the office... he did 3 teeth for me...asking after each one, \"\"are you okay to proceed to the next one\"\"?  How many dentists do you know that care that much?  I just love this dentist and never want anyone else...ever again!.\"\\nHe is great doctor.\\n\"I\\'m looking forward to experiencing Dr. Santos\\'s expert service and skills. \\nThank you. \"\\n\"I have been to several dentist offices in the past and I will never go anywhere else. From my first experience at this office to now I have not had a single problem. The office is very clean, the staff is very courteous, and Dr. Nur is awesome. I have always been afraid of dental procedures because of past experiences, I have had several procedures done by Dr. Nur and not only have I never had pain, but I\\'m no longer afraid anymore. He is very, professional and you know everything he is going to do before he does it. My Children currently attend a children\\'s dental office, but I am so impressed with Dr. Nur that I will be bringing them to see him. My experience at this office has been nothing but great and I will continue to have my dental work done here.\"\\nFront desk rude.  Dr only cares about his wallet and not patient\\'s treatment.  Forces work to be done to increase his wallet.  Not recomended.  Receptionist has the worst customer service.\\n\"I visited dr shakfa in Royal Oak, the office was great. It was very advanced with all the digital things and the staff were very friendly. I went to have 6 implants done, I was very nervous, but they advertise a spa-like atmosphere and it really was. My treatment was great and when i woke up I remembered noting and that was the BEST part. I really appreciated Dr.shakfa\\'s professional demeanor and his staff as well. \"\\nMy mother had the most difficult time using her dentures and she is 89. After suffering many problems with indigestion. DR SHAKFA and his nurses were the best. My 89 year old mother was very scared. She was sedated and was given 8 implants  and new teeth to chew with In no time and she ia having the best pork chop dinner ever.  Watching her eat again makes me so happy.  Watching my mother enjoying her life again brings tears to my eyes. Thank you dr. Shakfa\\n\"Dr shakfa was the best, He talked me all thru the procedure and explained everything for me, my implant was very quick and I hardly needed pain meds after. This is who you want to do yours if need one now!\"\\nOne of the best dentist ever.\\nExperiencing Dr. Nejad and his superb staff was like a sanctuary within the storm of frightening dental issues for me.  I feel very lucky that he is here in West Phoenix.  He is very much a professional as well as an understanding and dear man.\\nPeople are always pleasant and the dentist always gets me fixed up!\\nI met Dr Rahbar a few years ago and I fell in love with everyone in his office. They are so incredibly sweet and caring. Dr. Rahbar is by far the best dentist and one of the best people I have had the privilege of meeting. I would recommend him to any and everyone. \\n\"Great job! He kept saying\"\" Mazza Plaza\"\" during the whole appt.\"\\n\"Dr. Alas is a kind, understanding, and tremendously talented dentist.

Great experience.\\n\"I saw another dentist who told me that without immediate attention to a badly decayed tooth I would soon require a root canal.  I sought a second opinion. \\n\\nDr. Alas truly is a \"\"Five Star Dentist\"\".  His facility is modestly appointed, yet includes state of the art technical equipment.  His staff is expert and courteous.  Wait time for an appointment was 2 days. Wait time upon arrival was 5 minutes.  \\n\\nDr. Alas gave a corrected diagnosis and treatment.\\nRegistration papers available on line. Expert knowledge of insurance coverages.  Complete mastery of costs and payment options.  Professional and courteous\\n\"\\n\"Left my old Dentist and never looked back. Never have to wait when I visit. Nice staff. Great, no nonsense dentist. \"\\nThe atmosphere there. The doctors there and the staff are truly the best dentist in the world. \\nGreat dentist\\n\"worst experience ever, I took my parents their because the doctor and his staff speak Arabic. It was A BIG mistake, the doctor always in rush he never explains the conditions or the treatments . you feel that he wants to finish with you as soon as possible. his staff don\\'t seem to be happy about their work and tend to express their feeling to patients. I often felt they are really rude and forgot to tell me important information I was supposed to know.\"\\n\"Dr. Willson could not have been more kind and gentle! I told him how nervous I was, going to the dentist from childhood. He made my appointment painless! Great dentist to recommend !\"\\nExcellent dental provider. Friendly staff.\\n\"Dr. Moshrefi is extremely professional and knowledgeable. During my consult, Dr Moshrefi explained the procedure and answered my questions thoroughly. He has a beautiful office and his staff are very nice and professional. I highly recommend Dr. Moshrefi.\"\\nDr Yang is the best dentist I\\'ve ever had.  He has flexible hours and is always willing to accommodate my schedule.  He is caring and polite.  I\\'ve sent my entire family to him- and a few friends.  Everyone loves him\\nThe finest dentist I have ever visited\\n\"I had a scheduling conflict for my cleaning with my usual dentist so I was happy to get in fairly quickly with Dr. Lamanna. Plus, new patients get an electric toothbrush, which was great. She is very nice and the office is cutting edge. I was shocked at the end of my examination when she informed me I had three cavities needing fillings. I have a good history and never had a cavity in my adult life. It just didn\\'t sit well with me so I scheduled a second opinion with a different dentist. I\\'m glad I did because I had no cavities after all. It has been over a year since her false diagnosis so I\\'m positive they were not cavities. I gave her the benefit of the doubt since she is very nice and I don\\'t like to think of anyone as crooked, but after talking with a number of my friends who also saw her, they had similar experiences of a dramatic increase in cavities. I do not trust her nor do my friends. \"\\n\"I had a scheduling conflict for my cleaning with my usual dentist so I was happy to get in fairly quickly with Dr. Lamanna.  Plus, new patients get an electric toothbrush, which was great.  She is very nice and the office is cutting edge.\\n\\nI was shocked at the end of my examination when she informed me I had three cavities needing fillings.  I have a good history and never had a cavity in my adult life.  It just didn\\'t sit well with me so I scheduled a second opinion with a different dentist.

I did not like Dr Sayed s attitude   I would not recommend this dentist. \\nHad 4 teeth pulled the doctor and her assistant where professional and very sweet and caring\\nI have been going to dentist for years... I have always had dentist offices that are clean and everything is packaged and sterile. This office had the instrutments laying out on a desk. they have no dental hygienist  the doctor does the cleaning.  It needs serious cleaning light fixtures with no covers over them.  No place to spit you have to get up and spit and in a sink behind you. I recommend to anyone to find another dentist office that is clean and sterile.  It was hot in the office they have window units the assists was sweating all over because it was so hot. I am used to it be freeze to keep the germs down.  \\n\"Dr. Jadun is very friendly and caring.  The staff, wife and assistance always ver y kind.  Hours could be better, earlier.

This was all 2 year ago, After 2 surgeries and chemo.

I had a jaw tooth that had lost its filling and about 1/3 of the tooth had broke off. I had pain in my jaw bone and down my neck which concerned me, as I had heard horror stories about jaw bone infection. He was most polite, informative, compassionate, and I can\\'t imagine how things would have turned out if he couldn\\'t see me. He had a great sense of humor and his assistant Christina was a blessing. She made me comfortable and was a positive assistant. Also, I\\'d like to thank Traci Waters for her compassion and help during this time.\"\\n\"I must say for years I let my dental problems go to the waste side. I never had a decent dentist that cared, but when i mentioned being scared she did everything to make me comfort, she\\'d chit chat while they worked on $2,500 USD of work. and when her assisant left the room she\\'d hum to me. and when she recontructed my front two teeth I thought i\\'d lost something the smile i had a few years before yet she made them look exactly the same and helped me avoid having to get crowns. And when I cried in joy at the smile i thought was gone forever she didnt settle for giving a handshake, she gave me a hug. She smiles and laughed to at my happiness. You could tell she was just as happy as me she could give me back my smile. She is the sweetest most caring person I\\'ve met in the dental field and helped me get a loan for the 500$ USD balance i had that has 0% interest if i pay it off in the first year. I never imaged when they told me the extent of the dental work I\\'d need that that they could make my insurance pay for 2 k of it leaving me with only the cost of two extractions and a cleaning to coer. Her staff each and every one of them come and asked me how I\\'ve been since they last saw me if they noticed I\\'m in the office. Honestly they have achieved something lost in business today. They make you feel like family  and with the dentist being a scary place for almost everyone, thats a rarity in this field.\"\\n\"I recently received a had a root canal from Dr. Mychak. I was truly impressed with the professional nature of the office. His staff was excellent. They were all friendly, personable, and comforting. Dr. Mychak talked me through the entire procedure. Explaining what was happening and why. I appreciated his thoroughness. I did not experience any pain during or after the procedure. Which is astonishing because I have heard horror stories about root canals. i will drive 3 hours to visit his team.\"\\nI had to get a root canal. I\\'ve been hearing good things about north side dental so i decided to try my out. Dr Mychak was great! He made me feel nice and comfortable during the procedure. Then the next day his receptionist called to see how I was doing. I\\'ve never had a dentist do that before! Great Dentist and staff! I would highly recommend them! \\ni would never suggest anyone to go see him he is very inconsiderate very rude about peoples pain has no compassion for his patients\\nI saw Dr. Mychak at north side dental. The staff is very courteous and within minutes of my appointment I was called back! He was very friendly and efficient. He found a cavity on one of my molars and fixed it the same day! I was shocked. I couldn\\'t even tell there was a filling and it was my front tooth. would definitely recommend him!\\n\"he was pretty good, I needed a root canal and they got me an appointment with the specialist the next day.  Only complaint is the filling I got afterward is a little weird feeling because I cant floss on that tooth.  I still need to get the crown.  \"\\nterrible dentist....terrible!\\nCame to appointment with a toothache and Dr. Mychak got me taken care of!

I would definitely recommend him for any of your dental needs\\n\"I would recommend this dentist to my family and friends. He is a very caring Dr. I have a fear of dentists.

He gave me exceptional dental care, considering where I started. I was in a car accident years ago,resulting in severe damage to my front teeth. I had emergency work done at the time by another doctor, but the work was just enough to get me by. I was so self-conscious that I rarely showed my teeth, I used my hand to hide my smile all the time. My smile transformation was a dramatic change for me, and all for the better! Thanks Dr. Ace!\"\\nTop notch service and knowledge. Definitely recommend!!\\n\"I needed my flipper repaired, and Dr. Ace was able to do it the same day, while I waited.  He even polished up so nice it looks brand new. Thanks for helping me out!\"\\n\"I live close by, in Sun City, and chose Dr. Ace based off of my neighbors recommendation. Iam really glad I did. Dr. Ace helped me out a lot and I appreciate all of the great staff that made me feel at home!\"\\n\"Basically, everyone in my family has bad teeth, including me. Iave had a lot of dental work done over my lifetime, and I\\'ve always had a little bit of pain/ sensitivity afterwards. (I\\'ve come to accept pain as part of the process). I recently moved to Austin, from California, and needed to get some work redone. I found Dr. Ace on Google, so I went in for a consultation, and was pleased to get such a thorough evaluation, with photos and all. I was scheduled by Brooke to get the procedure done on a Tuesday, and I was expecting to feel the same pain I always felt. Come Wednesday morning, I didn\\'t feel a thing! Nothing! It was amazing!\"\\n\"Dr. Ace redid some old veneers I had placed in my 40s. I am now 55, and I look (and feel) better today, than I did back then! My smile has a lot to do with it, thank you Dr. Ace for giving me an amazing smile!\"\\n\"I was in need of an implant and crown and wanted someone to fix it that new what they were doing. The Dr. was very clear on the options that I had and helped me make the choice that was best for me and not necessarily for his pocketbook. They were able to work with me on a payment plan, making it much easier to afford.\"\\n\"Suffering from dry mouth for years, I had a lot of deterioration of my teeth. I was worried about getting dentures, so I got a consult with Dr. Ace about my options. I was happy to learn about the All-on4 bridge, or permanent teeth. I had all of my teeth pulled and Dr. Ace placed a permanent bridge that same day. Amazing. I have 1 more month left of healing, but overall my experience has been positive. I will never need to worry about having pain in my teeth, and can now chew pretty much anything. My wife loves my new smile, and I only wish that I had done it sooner. Thanks Dr. Ace.\"\\n\"Both my wife and I are patients of Dr Ace and we couldn\\'t be more pleased with their services. Their entire staff is professional, courteous, and really a pleasure to be around. Their technology is state-of-the-art! On a scale of 1 to 5 stars this dental practice is a 10! If you\\'re looking for the best in dental care, this is the place.\"\\nHe is good Doctor\\nHe is good Doctor\\nHe is good Doctor\\nGreat dentist.  Doesn\\'t do work that is not needed.  Explains everything to you.  So glad to have found Dr. Miller for my dentist.  \\n\"I have to commend Dr. Lousignont.  I am so used to going to dentists and having them spend a few minutes looking in my mouth before rattling off a list of work I need done.  Then I leave wondering if all of it is really necessary.  Dr. Lousignont took the time to look me straight in the eye and explain to me what was actually going on and WHY I needed the work done.   Very thorough and understandable and when he was done I really felt like I understood what was going on in my mouth and he wasn\\'t just trying to make a quick buck off of me.  \\n\\nWhen it came to the actual treatment, I tend to be pretty nervous about the dentist especially the shots.  I swear I never felt a thing.  \\n\\nOne complaint though I wouldn\\'t really call it a complaint is once in a while the wait is a bit long.  But then when I see him I remember why.  Because he is so thorough and takes time to actually LISTEN.  So in a way I can appreciate the wait because I know he won\\'t rush through my visit.  \\n\\nOh, and his staff is great also!  Very friendly and very helpful.  \"\\n\"I love my Doctor. He\\'s the best. I\\'m his patient for many years.\\nHighly recommend.\\nIrina Conte\"\\n\"Dr. Adam, He\\'s my DOCTOR ! He is the BEST! He always make me smile :)\"\\nThis dental clinic is really terrible. They let me waited for hours.It took this dentist more than a year to finish my upper teeth; took him months to finish the implants. And the finish product? My upper teeth still look awful and not equal sizes!. There is still the obvious gap on the side.I wasted my money and insurance for this crappy job. His dental assistant did some of his work that should not be done by a dental assistant.\\n\"Smart, innovative, and GENTLE YES!  I personally need \\'gentle\\' in a dentist. And the cost truly is affordable Im so thankful I was able to get the 2 implants I needed. So glad I found NADIC and Dr Adam.  The staff is friendly and on the ball.\"\\n\"This is the worst doctor you could ever go to. The office of this doctor was unclean and smelling of shoe odor when I went. The reason I am giving a bad review is because :\\n1. When I told the doctor my problem, he said \"\"I don\\'t know exactly  what\\'s the cause, may be talk out wisdom tooth\"\". I hate when a doctor with years of experience gives me a I-don\\'t-know reply. You have studied dentistry, you ought to know and if you don\\'t know, suggest me a different doctor or let me go. \\n2. He did a very superficial cleaning of my teeth, the cleaning was done in less that 120 seconds. \\n3. The room in which the cleaning was done was filthy (trash coming out of trash bins)\\n4. Before taking the x-rays, the doctor\\'s office did not tell me what kind of x rays they are taking. I ended up paying most of the cost of x-rays myself. I wouldn\\'t have mind this had I received a good treatment. \\n5. When you call the doctor\\'s office, nobody talks to you. The attendants or customer service representatives simply say \"\"we are busy, cannot locate your record , we will call you later\"\". And they never call. I wanted to discuss my billing inquiries and I kept calling them 3-4 times in 2 days.\\n6. To my surprise, this office has no computer or IT systems to maintain patient\\'s records. Everything is done on papyrus. \"\\nDentist is very nice and knowledgeable; he makes you to feel comfortable.  Office is cozy and clean with latest technology.\\n\"Worst cleaning ever. Cleaning done by Dr. Maslow, no hygienist, and he rushes through it. 15 minutes max. \"\\n\"Wow, he was really nice and gentle. \"\\n\"I loved my 15 minutes with Dr. Sandbag. I used to go to Dr. Johnson but he just doesn\\'t do it for me anymore. Now that I\\'m into my late 60\\'s, I needed some new spice in my life. This young lad is not only smart but also foxy and charming. He really knows what he\\'s talking about which makes me feel better about my visits. I would love to smack his tight rump but that would be inappropriate. Maybe dr sandbag should just stop wearing tight khakis and make it easier on us women. I\\'ve told all my friends at Courtyard Estates about Dr Sandbag and needless to say I\\'m sending some Cougars his way. Watch out Sandbag! monmouth\\'s frisky for you!  \"\\n\"Dr. Sanberg really knows how to scrape that plaque. He also rocks that floss like nobody\\'s business. He always stands in front of me when talking and looks me in the eye which is mega-cool of him. He totally rocks my socks off when he wears his emerald green mask. I know the mask prevents him from breathing on me, but I wish he would. I bet his breath is always minty fresh. I also wish he would cut the sleeves off his scrubs so I can see those arms flex for me baby. Whenever I go in for an appointment, he\\'s always on time which makes me think he wants me.  Hopefully he\\'s not married... Anyway, you all should totally check out Adam. He\\'s got a set of skills that could turn any straight man g to the a to the y\"\\n\"I saw Dr. S. Abtin in the Mcdonough ga Dentist office and it was the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER FROM ANY DENTIST I HAVE HAD DENTAL WORK DONE BY. Read in detail how he damaged me and I don\\'t understand why.. it is detailed on healthgrades, other reviews and Mcdonough ga dentistry office reviews. I am still sick.This man acts as if he purposely destroyed and put me in pain, it has been two weeks now. I am still swollen, still paining, headaches, still colored purple red , blue , black from top of eye to bottom of chin. Very unprofessional. His young assistance told me laughing that my husband , my support guy has left me in there alone. you have no support. She laughed . She wrote down a fake number pretending to take a bp and laughed. Why?  I told that dr.Abtin , she wrote down a made up number and he said that was okay. UNBELIEVABLE, I froze in time. Why say all that kind of garbage. It was so sickening. I don\\'t have any medical problems but now since having and trusting mr. Abtin, to  my dental health tooth extraction.. I am constantly still in pain. Patients, I knew nothing about this dentist all he worked in that mcdoough office as the only oral surgeon.  That was Bad , awful.... Check out reviews I didn\\'t ----now look at me face partially disfigured.  mouth inside terribly still swollen . can get a fork in my mouth. Patients we got to search to find the good doctors. Pleasesearch the internet reviews.. I am a healthy senior citizens no medical problems until after seeing him. My headace will not go away. Why was he so rough with me? I have good insurance and was in great good health. This place is more so a ghetto whole unknowing to patients especially from the reviews I have read and seen. Ridiculous. Medical Boards needs to know. I have pictures. Worst doctor Abtin, S. Ever.  \"\\nVery patient and excellent dentist has been dentist last 8 years\\nVery little wait in the office or for an appointment when you call with an emergency.  They also have weekend and evening hours.  I am slightly phobic of the dentist and was made very comfortable and everything was explained beforehand and every attmept was made to make it as pain free as possible.  \\n\"Dr. Miller performed a difficult extraction of one of my molars. It was absolutely the best, most pain-free extraction I\\'ve ever experienced. I will certainly return to him for any further dental surgery I may require.\"\\n\"Dr. Monroe is an engaging dentist, I believe he is genuinely interested in his patients. He was flexible in his approach to resolving my problem and worked within the constraints of my business travel. I would a have happily given a 5-star rating across the board but felt the price for a root canal was a bit high. In fairness, he utilizes some advanced micro-drilling technology that makes smaller openings and less structural damage to the tooth. This may account for the price premium. I would recommend him to other people.\"\\n\"Great dentists & staff.  Love this place!\\n\"\\n\"The dr and staff are nice , but dealing with their billing practices, etc was one big hassle. What they told me I owed them was always different than what my insurance company said. Twice I had to contact Dr. Lalonde himself to get my balance zeroed out. I also asked them to send my records to our new dentist when we moved out of state, they didn\\'t do it and then told me I had to sign a release after we moved. They also use a device called a diagnodent to diagnose early cavities. They were always telling me I needed fillings and after a second opinion they told me I had no cavities.  I would not recommend them. \"\\nI love the friendly staff.  They are very professional and proficient with all aspects of the office.  Dr. Lee is amazing and makes me feel like family when I go to his office.\\n\"Great care, not available enough.\"\\n\"Great office, great staff. Not real happy with the dentist. Went in for a toothache and was talked into a root canal. Dentist drilled the root canal and I was sent home to wait for the crown. I was back in a couple of days because of excruciating pain only to be told that the tooth needed to be extracted because \"\"these things happen.\"\" during the extraction the tooth was broken and the roots had to be dug out of the gums. When I asked to see the tooth I was told it had been thrown away and could not be retrieved. I honestly believe the procedure had been botched. I don\\'t know, maybe my situation was an aberration, I sure hope so. Still, I can\\'t recommend this dentist.\"\\nVery nice office and staff seemed kind\\nExcellent care\\n\"Dr. McKissock is a very kind and caring dentist.

Took well over 2 months to get my first set of trays even after repeated calls (unreturned) and finally a visit to see where my money went.  Finally they arrived and I went through the process until it came to the second set of trays.  Again months go by and no news about the trays... many calls later the dentist realizes that the trays had been in the back office!!!  All this and many hours of waiting way after the appointment time and nearly 2 years later they declare the process over.  I am finally left with 2 upper front teeth that are slanting to the right and three bottom front teeth slanting to the left!  He had the nerve to say everything looks finea.

Before getting the crown, I asked if I could speak to him about options of materials used on the crown. I had hoped to be able to get his expert opinion and then jointly make a choice with him. As I began to ask questions and discuss the topic, he accused me of being anxious and lacking confidence in him. He also accused me of not signing a consent form. I had never been given the consent form and never knew anything about it. He then asked me to leave his office. I was very surprised by this experience. I never knew it was not okay to learn about and make choices about a medical procedure being done to me. He falsely interpreted my inquisitive nature and was judgmental, cold, and hostile towards me.\"\\n\"Love visiting Dr. Carmean!  Compassionate, caring and relieves ALL stress!

He sprayed my daughters mouth with water and when I said why not let her rinse, he explained st the chair was broken, that is not a good excuse.

Most of my family have been going to him for many years and continue to so needless to say I am extremely confident in his expertise and in recommending him. Unfortunately my insurance required that I use Dentists within the plan in order to be covered. To make a long story short I had an emergency issue with my front tooth, the dentist I was going to wanted to pull the tooth, not an option for me so i turned to Dr. Cohen. Dr. Cohen on the other hand was able to fix it, and you cannot even tell where the damaged was. I am so grateful for his expertise and am very thankful that I went to him to have it fixed. An honest and professional doctor, staff was wonderful and accomodating. Worth going out of my insurance for, I am just so happy to be smiling with confidence again.\"\\nI go to Dr. Cohen when no one else can figure out what the problem is and he always solves it!\\nThe hygenists are very thourough.  The Dr. always examines once the cleaning is done.  He has filled several cavities and repaired a chipped tooth.  All without pain or discomfort.   The tooth repair was perfect.  I find him to be personable and professional.\\nToo busy. Supervised neglect! Substandard treatment! \\nAppointments are limited due to moving his practice from office to office.\\n\"I am so happy with my implants! They have been in for over 6 years, they look awesome! Thanks\"\\n\"I have had some major work done this summer at Dr. Cook\\'s office.  Dr. Cook let me know two or three years ago that I was going to have to do something, time enough to upgrade my dental insurance.   Throughout the process he treated me as a partner, occasionally even emailing me after hours to bring up ideas or to see how I was doing.  The work itself was expensive and unpleasant, but the results are fabulous.  And everyone at Dr. Cook\\'s office, from the receptionist to the hygienist to his assistant, has been exceedingly pleasant and professional.  I really can\\'t say enough about Dr. Cook\\'s deep investment in the work he does and in his patients\\' well-being, and this attitude is contagious in his office.  (PS: I told them this morning that I had never picked up a magazine in their office.  I have literally never once had time to sit down in the waiting room before they call me back.)\"\\n\"I always have a wonderful experience at Dr. Cook\\'s office.  I\\'ve had a root canal (and yes it too was a wonderful experience--pain free!).  Dr. Cook is so calm and gentle, and his staff are very friendly and comforting.  Highly recommend!\"\\n\"The entire staff is very courteous, attentive and thorough.\"\\nBest experience at a dentist office I\\'ve ever had\\n\"The office is a little dated, but Dr. Cook has really invested in new technologies, like digital xrays and cameras, that give it a high-tech feel.  The staff is very nice, and Dr. Cook is very professional and thorough.  His shots were painless, and my fillings look and feel great.  Highly recommend!\"\\nI started my day at the dentist office with Dr. Aaron Cook and his staff. Dr. Cook repaired bonding on my upper front teeth with a gentleness that immediately erased any hint of anxiety. He recreated a look that keeps me smiling and enhanced the function of my teeth (meaning my bite feels great)! I am so thankful to have a very competent and skilled dentist who is so passionate about his work!\\nGreat practice!  Dr. Cook is caring and gentle.  I felt very comfortable during my visit.\\n\"A relaxed and comfortable environment, professional staff. Dr Cook is a kind and gentle dentist, stress free experience\"\\nBest experience at a dentist I\\'ve ever had!\\n\"Caring, gentle dentist.  Dr. Cook is a wonderful dentist!\"\\nDr Cook is an amazing dentist with a comforting chair side manner.  He did some cosmetic work for me that makes me look 20 years younger.  He is very gentle and I didn\\'t feel a thing.  His staff is great as well--highly recommend!!\\nWe tried the Children Dentist off College first and my daughter cried both visits and was scared to go. I found Groovy Smiles and took her to see Dr. Forrester. She absolutely loved him from the first visit. He is great with children and makes them laugh and feel comfortable. She was excited after losing her first tooth because she couldn\\'t wait to show her new Dentist! Happy Conway has a Dentist of this caliber. Thanks!\\n\"Once you go to Dr. Gerson you\\'ll never go anywhere else.   Customer service is amazing, he runs a tight crew and on time.  Enjoy the ocean view and breeze while there!  I moved out of town and still drive to Dr. Gerson for cleanings and problems.  He knows what he is doing, does what is necessary for healthy mouth and won\\'t try to up sale you.   You can\\'t go wrong!\"\\n\"very nice to patients but he will get you in the pocket .He sooner or later suggests you need really expensive procedures an gets you in the wallet, as well as your insurance. If you do not want to end up with a veneer/ceramic mouth in the end of your years ,do not go there.\"\\n\"The Dr. was impatient and not as caring as I anticipated!  He knows what he is doing I feel but, has NO heart.  Very poor bedside manner.  A very bad manager of pain.  Rude.  The worst experience I have ever had going to a dentist.  I would never go back.\"\\n\"I have never ever had an issue with going to a Dentist till I came to this office. A week ago I came in with a hole in one of my molars and it hurt to eat and drink. After paying out of pocket for X-Rays and an exam, I waited 3 hours in the waiting room till I was finally called back. They took ONE X-Ray, and then the dentist came in, looked at my tooth for no more than 20 seconds and left. I was then rescheduled for an appointment a week later. Like I stated before, I have NEVER had any issues with pain or anxiety. After he started to drill, he kept yelling at me to open wider. I was opening so wide that my lips were shaking. It was not good enough for him. He got frustrated, left and came back a few minutes later and finished which involved him yelling at me two more times. When he was done, he stood up and walked out without saying anything to me. His assistant told me to have a nice day and that was it....I have NEVER in my life been treated like that in a doctor\\'s office before. I will NEVER go back there again...stay away from this doctor!\"\\n\"I can not tell you how upset I am with this man. My son, who is 8, went in this morning for his first filling. My son has ADHD, OCD and Tourette\\'s so it\\'s not the easiest thing in the world for him to sit still - but he gave it his best. The dentist got so upset with him because he would move his head a little (tics from the Tourette\\'s) and didn\\'t keep his mouth wide enough. He fussed at my son, got ugly with him, jerked his mouth open and told him he was too old to be acting this way and that he should be more brave. He then stood up from his chair and told him when he could get his act together he would come back. Then my son busted out crying and then so did I at the sight of him. The Dr came back about 10 minutes later and asked if he was ready now. He began placing the filling and my son, who was by this point scared to move an inch, let out a whimper. The dentist said \"\"Oh come on man, you know it doesn\\'t hurt. You should be an actor with all that whining, you are really good at it\"\" and pulled his mouth wider. He finally got the filling done, pushed the button to raise my son\\'s seat and walked out of the room shaking his head. Then my son starts crying again telling me he was sorry he was such a bad boy. I told him he was brave. Never ever ever take your child to Abdel Darensburg. He is horrible with children.\"\\n\"Dr. Darensburg is a very caring and compassionate dentist who is surrounded by staff that are NOT compassionate,competent or caring in his South Carolina office.  The receptionist feel the need to speak on his behalf and treat patients on the phone as if they are clueless and they do NOT give the doctor his messages. He needs new staff that will give him urgent messages that could be a matter of life or death and NOT make diagnosis and assumptions on his behalf.  This happened to me earlier this month as I tried to leave him an urgent message and instead of them alerting the doctor, they treated me as if I were a clueless patient with no choice and they never informed him I even called. Give him a new staff at his South Carolina office so he can continue to give the best dental care that he gives.  \"\\n\"I was looking for the best and most experienced orthodontist for my son\\'s invasalign and orthodonture treatments.  It was well worth the drive from Massachusetts to see Dr. Gilman.  I know it\\'s a long distance but Dr. Gilman made it easy.  He used the best available technology and my son found the entire experience to be comfortable - I never got a single complaint about his orthodontic treatments!  The office is fun, clean, and professional.  If you want only the best treatment, this is the place to go and the dentist to see.\"\\nfrom the time I walked through the door I recieved friendly and helpful service with the front desk staff and received extremly good care from Dr.Benbajja. I refered all my family to start going to see him. Very pleased! \\nDr. Davis is by far my most favorite Dentist! \\n\"He was a really nice guy, but he isn\\'t easy on your teeth when they hurt.\"\\nWe love Dr. Goodman.

However, he thoroughly included me in the exam,  spoke with excitement and joy and DID NOT SUGAR COAT!! Dr. Haider left me CONFIDENT that my dental situation would be fully attended.   A rare breed,  indeed.   He has me as a client for life!!!\"\\n\"Why you should avoid this dentist:\\n1) provides \"\"upgrades\"\" without clearly explaining that it will cost you out of pocket or offering a choice of procedures or providing any written statement ahead of time\\n2) makes you sign a legal statement that you are satisfied with the work  before you are even out of the chair\\n3) takes medically unnecessary x-rays for \"\"documentation\"\" (in case you complain) \\n4) have an office policy to be \"\"friendly\"\" but they have trouble remembering it.\"\\nWonderful a true artist.   My new bite is perfect.\\nExcellent surgeon!\\n\"I like this dentist office. You hear horror stories, but the people here are great and friendly. They care about you and try to get to know you a little better so you\\'re not just a patient. \"\\n\"No finer dentists anywhere   Skilled,  kind, concerned, perfectionists. Staff is affable, professional and just all-around nice!\"\\n\"This doctor is not for everyone. I\\'m not saying he\\'s not a good endodontist but I had a horrible experience and will never go back. He is wired, electric, talks over others. First, while I was sitting getting prepped for the procedure, he was talking about how difficult his previous patient was and how he had to handle him. Then, he bragged how he was the best at what he does. During the procedure he was VERY agressive. I lifted my hand to ask for a break because I was in pain to what he replied \"\"put your hand down\"\". Wish I could have walked out immediatly. Very rough, agressive guy. \"\\n\"I have had many root canal procedures, but my experience with Dr. Isler was exceptional.  I had two root canal procedures performed at the same time.  The process was painless and quick.  He is very professional as is his staff, but he is also personable and puts his patients quickly at ease.  He also uses the very latest technology for excellent results.   I highly recommend Dr. Isler.\\n \"\\nPain free.  \\nWas able to get appointment with 24 hours. Experience was pain free!\\n\"What I say might save you pain\\nWhat I speak might save your teeth\\n\\nHands gone clap and feet gone tap\\nSee Doc Isler to beat that rap!\"\\nGreat dentist\\nBest dentist ever. Always worried of causing any pain.\\n\"Adam Carson is an excellent Dentist.  He was very accommodating around my busy schedule and explained the work that I needed thoroughly.  He answered any questions that I had and fixed my dental issues...\\n\\nEvery time that I went to his office he was always on time and ready for my visit, I did not have to wait more than 5 minutes to get into the chair.\\n\\nHe also went out of his way to refer me to an endodontist.  \\n\\nI highly recommend anyone in the Miami Beach are to check Dr. Adam Carons office out!\"\\nAbsolutely not satisfied fake manners should try his chances at Hollywood with no luck\\nHe will practically force you to do expensive dental treatment you absolutely do not need\\nAwesome dentist knows what he\\'s doing. Good patient manners & caring I will return.\\nI had a good experience with a root canal.   There was a TV on the ceiling but no headphones were offered to watch it.\\nThe office staff are friendly and efficient. Dr. Dew is very friendly and thorough and genuinely responsive to your dental necessities and wellness concerns. The office itself is pleasant and comfortable. My kids look forward to going to the dentist!\\ndefinitely glad I choose abby dew and her staff they are awesome and I felt at ease the whole time I was there.\\n\"Family oriented office, very welcoming staff, doctor always smiling, friendly and very gentle and makes you feel comfortable. Highly recommended\"\\nBe sure and ask questions in regards to what type of material they prefer to use on your teeth.  Billing / Reception staff could use customer service training. \\nI have been a patient of Dr Frounfelter for over a year he is an Awesome Dentist very kind and gentle with me .I would recommend him to any one looking for a great Dentist . Very friendly staff. \\nI don\\'t think people should go here for wisdom teeth extractions! I don\\'t want to say anything more because I don\\'t want to be a target of a lawsuit.\\nI really didn\\'t like the way Dr. Bateman treated me.\\nI wouldn\\'t go here even if it was free. \\n\"I was so impressed with Dr. Bateman\\'s kindness, knowledge and prompt response to my needs.  He was professional and caring.  I would highly recommend him!\"\\nUnimpressed with his staff and the service. Along with the followup care. I feel like the follow up care was the worst of it all.\\nI actually can\\'t think of a single person I dislike enough to recommend Dr. Bateman to them.\\n\"I have never been more afraid to go back to a doctor. After my wisdom teeth extraction I had complications, but because Dr. Bateman had been so negligent I was afraid to go back. I had to talk to my other healthcare professionals about all my questions.\"\\nI would think somebody with this many baf reviews would try to make things right instead of getting so many bad reviews. I am not impressed with him at all\\nI\\'m actually surprised he has any 5 star reviews...\\nIt was shocking to me just how bad he made me feel especially because I don\\'t think that he cared that I felt he treated me so bad. I am just disgusted with him. Also hearing that he is the kind of person to sue his patients makes me wish I would have read up on him more before going to him. I feel like I have to be careful and not even give the whole story here because I certainly don\\'t want a threatining letter in the mail . I wish I could tell you all who read this the whole story. But when I have to be worried about a doctor suing me for writing what happened I just don\\'t want that. DO NOT GO HERE.\\n\"Seriously, I was so unhappy with him. He definitely has bad reviews for a reason! I had some issues and tried to call him to work it out and he said he didn\\'t care because he deals with it all the time.\"\\n\"I had the best experience with Dr. Bateman.  He explained the proceedure throughly and I didn\\'t even have any pain afterward!\\nHe is Great!\"\\nI definitely wouldn\\'t trust him with my teeth!\\nI was very dissatisfied with my experience with Dr. Bateman. I\\'ll certainly never go back! I wouldn\\'t recommend him to anyone!\\nMy recommendation to anybody reading this review would be to find another person to do your treatment.  My experience with Dr. Bateman has been dismal. I have worked with a lot of different doctors and had quite a few things done. This guy is in my opinion the absolute worst. Please do yourself a favor and go to anybody else. \\nI was not impressed with him.\\nHe\\'s not the kind of doctor I\\'d go back to.\\nExcellent dentist\\nI definitely wouldn\\'t recommend this doctor to anyone.\\n\"I had my first appointment with Dr. Bergman today. He is a pleasant, mild-mannered man, who made me feel very comfortable throughout the entire visit. Everything that he needed to do to my tooth was carefully explained to me, all questions that I had were answered to my satisfaction, and I experienced NO pain or discomfort. I would have no hesitation at all in recommending him to family and friends. \"\\n\"Yesterday I received an email from Dr. Bateman\\'s lawyer. It said \"\" if you fail to comply, including the removal of the prior posts, then we will pursue legal action against you, which will include recovery for the loss of goodwill and monetary damages in the amount of tens of thousands of dollars or more, plus punitive and exemplary damages.\"\" \\nI am disappointed that Dr. Bateman is the kind of doctor that would threaten to sue one of his patients for expressing themselves on the internet.\"\\n\"This is the best dentist/endodontist that I have ever been to. I saw him when he was in Largo and now that e moved to Oviedo. He\\'s very thorough, asks questions and listens, takes his time with you, very honest and must of all, has silk hands (you don\\'t feel a thing!). Last time I went to see him, as I was walking out of the office I commented to my husband who was in the waiting room, how good the doctor had been and another patient there told me \"\"he\\'s so good that he should be giving classes to other dentists\"\".\"\\nFabulous staff and doctor. Never have to wait long!\\nBiggest RIP OFF ever!  I\\'ve never had such an AWFUL experience with any doctor!  He\\'s in it for the money only!  Awful bedside manner!  Awful business ethic!  STAY AWAY!!\\n\"I would not recommend this doctor to any friends and family!  I did not care for his bedside manner.  He was very aggressive with the procedure he opted to do.  I also felt that he did not listen carefully to my concerns, but acted as if he knew better and plowed through with his idea of what should be done.  We did not receive any follow up care unless we sought it and had more than the suggested or usual recovery time, according to other doctors we sought, due to the aggressive nature in which he did our procedure.  We went to another doctor for needed follow up medication not given.\"\\nDr. Bateman is phenomenal! He is very kind very happy and treated my daughter with professionalism and also comforting kindness.  His staff is excellent as well! They did all the paperwork chasing for insurance and also they told me about the discount for paying cash... saved us over $100! Thank you!!! YOU ARE APPRECIATED!!!\\n\"First I  USE TO HATE THE DENTIST Dr. Bateman changed that all. He is highly professional, extemely personable. He explained everything in simple to understand terms, went over all my concerns and overall experience was great! I would refer him to anyone seriously! \"\\n\"my husband was afraid of the dental, coming from another country. He came to Dr. Frieder in acute pain and has been with him for years.

Recently,  I had to go into Dr Saunders\\' office though, because  I had chipped off a sizeable portion of my front tooth. I was a little nervous at first, but Dr Saunders was so gentle and calming with his mannerisms and tone, that I immidiately began to relax because I knew I was in good hands. He worked wonders on my tooth; he did an amazing job repairing it to its\\' original condition, in both color and shape. I was impressed at the great deal of time and attention he gave to the little details in the shape of my tooth.

I went in there to get 3 teeth pulled.  At first they quoted me a bill for $8685. I told them that I didnat need all the extra treatments they wanted to do, I just want my teeth pulled for the advertised price of $89. At that point the office assistant said aOKa. It took the dentist less than 30 seconds to extract each tooth, 3 total. After they were finished I was told they charged my Motheras credit card $944. (Which I have to pay back). They knew the amount I was able to spend and with plenty of opportunity to properly inform me that they werenat going to charge me $89 a tooth but instead charge me $295 a tooth plus the $59 for X-ray (no cleaning as advertised). If I was properly informed I would have not consented to this treatment because at the moment I am unemployed and living with relatives. I was in a lot of pain and my mom offered to put the amount on her credit card for what she thought was $89 a tooth.  There are a lot of great dentist out there that truly care about their patients and not just how much money they can squeeze out of them each time they come in for a visit.

I just read an article about extracting teeth that have had a \"\"root canal.\"\"  I\\'m interested to see if the health concerns for safety about extracting these teeth, that may be lying dormant and causing disease, is true. \"\\nNothing but the best to say about this practice and its doctors & staff!!!\\n\"The DaVinci of Dental Surgery!! Outstanding care, technically excellent and wonderful commitment to his patients.\"\\n\"Dr. Eisenburg took an x-ray and wanted to do a root canal on my 13 y/o son\\'s front tooth after my ortho noted my son had a cavity. I decided to get a second opinion (thank goodness!!) and the other dental office said it only was a cavity, with no need for a root canal and crown!! When I had called to reschedule the root canal app\\'t with Dr. Eisenburg because I was getting a second opinion, his office cancelled my son\\'s as well as my own appointment entirely! I guess he knew that a reliable honest dentist would tell me it was only a cavity. I am so glad I got away from that office and that my son doesn\\'t have to spend his life with a false front tooth because the Dr. Eisenburg was money hungry at the expense of a child!!!! \"\\n\"The dentist did not do a good cosmetic job on my teeth. Looks too artificial and now i have a more obvious flaw than before.  It is very upsetting that after a long conversation about my dental concerns, he was able to convince me that he could cosmetically correct my teeth, but then he refused  to correct the bad job done even at an extra expense.   No I am stucked with mismatched tooth until I am able to get another doc to redo the job.  On a minor note, he\\'s known to cancel & reschedule appontments with short notices which at times made my schedule difficult.\"\\nI HAD BEEN SCARED OF THE DENTIST FOR YEARS...I AM 48 YEARS OLD AND HAD A PHOBIA FO R YEARS..I FOUND DR CALDERONE 2 YEARS AGO AND IS THE BEST. HE TAKES TIME TO EXPLAIN THINGS AND WANTS YOU PAIN FREE. I HAD A PROBLEM ONE NIGHT AND HE CALLED ME BACK RIGHT AWAY..IF SOMEONE TOLD ME THERE WAS A BETTER DENTIST I WOULDNT BELIEVE THEM. DOCTOR CALDERONE IS THE BEST\\n\"I have been a patient of Wantagh dental for 15 years. Before Dr. Calderone took over the practice, The previous dentist always worked with me with payment knowing that my financial situation was horrible. My mouth needs extensive work and I always experience a lot of pain. Due to having 3 children and a disabled husband who can\\'t work because of 5 major spine surgeries has left us to struggle financially. I was just turned away from Dr C. , knowing that I was in excruciating pain because my bill wasn\\'t paid in full. Keep in mind, I have given that practice thousands of dollars through the years and always make large payments towards my outstanding balance every visit. He has no compassion and basically dumped me and left me to be in pain with a severe infection and without a dentist. I would not recommend him at all. He will turn on you in your time of need, just like he did to me.\"\\n\"Dr. Hershkin had an extremely professional and caring manner, which put me at ease immediately.  I would recommend him to everyone who needs oral surgery. Judy, at the front desk, was very kind, friendly and efficient. \"\\nHe saw me a very short notice....good experience\\nMy wisedom teeth being extracted was much more manageable than anticipated.\\n\"Dr. Fettig and his staff were wonderful for my routine wisdom teeth removal.  I felt very cared for during my first appointment, the actual surgery appointment, and a follow-up appointment due to a slight complication unrelated to their surgical process in any way.  They were quick to respond to my calls and concerns and never made me feel like I was complaining too much or was abnormal. Extremely kind and professional staff! You can tell that they do this a lot. Would 100% recommend. \"\\n\"Office staff is courteous, professional and kind.  Dr. Fettig explained everything in great detail.  \"\\nVery supportive office.  Had to change appointment several times due to illness...no problems.  When a problem arose...they got us in the same day I called!!\\n\"I hope I do not need any more teeth extracted, if I am in need I will certainly return to this office.  Very quick, no problems after, did not need pain pills.\"\\nGreat service and care.\\nPerfect everything !\\n\"DR. HILL IS AN EXCELLENT DENTIST. HE IS TRULY INTERESED, CONCERNED ABOUT ANY DENTAL PROBLEM YOU MAY HAVE. I HAD A VERY SIGNIFICANT DENTAL PROBLEM; ALMOST UNSOLVABLE AS THE TREATMENT WOULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE AND WITHIN DR. HILL\\'S AREA OF EXPERTISE. HE FOUND A DENTIST WHO SPECIALIZED IN MY PROBLEM AND WAS SLIGHTLY MORE AFFORDABLE THAN OTHER SPECIALISTS THAT I SAW. DR. HILL FOLLOWED ME THROUGH THE TREATMENT.   MY ONLY RECOMMENDATION IS A MORE COMPREHENSIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT. I AM IN MY LATE 60\\'S SO I HAVE BEEN TO SEVERAL + DENTISTS AND I PLACE DR. HILL AT THE TOP IN GENERALIZED DENTISTRY.\"\\n\"HURT MY TEETH FOR ADDTIONAL PROPIT , AND I NOW WILL NEVER GO TO A DENTIST EVERY AGAIN.\"\\nI could give you a long list of complaints about this practice.  One in particular that he is a below average dentist and his work shows it.\\n\"I have been seeing Dr. Goodman for a little over a year and the Invisalign treatment he designed for me has been extremely satisfying. My teeth had moved over the course of time to the point that I felt like I needed an adjustment.\\n\\nFrom the beginning, Dr Goodman takes the time to discuss with you the process you will be going through with clear expectations of what to expect. At each appointment with him, he will review with you how your teeth are adjusting and where he expects changes to take place. I followed his directions as prescribed and wore my liners for the recommended 20 hours a day. Initially, I was turned off by the number of attachments I needed but quickly got over it. There was very little discomfort and the assistants worked closely with me if adjustments were needed to make the liners more comfortable to wear.\\n\\nAfter the first appointment and at the very beginning of treatment, he showed me a video of how my teeth will be changing throughout the course of treatment. The video was such a great incentive to keep wearing the liners! The staff at the office make the frequent office visits very quick and pleasant. It really isn\\'t a huge inconvenience to have a checkup every 4-6 weeks.\\n\\nWhat I really love about Dr. Goodman is that when he feels the treatment needs to be adjusted, he never hesitates to order new liners after taking new images of how my alignment changed. He\\'s done this twice for me and each time I feel like I\\'m getting a better degree of adjustment.\\n\\nI\\'m close to completing my treatment and my teeth are better aligned now than they have ever been. Do not hesitate to see Dr. Goodman. Working with him is one of the best decisions I have ever made!\"\\n\"I had a 9:00 am appt. I was checked in by the Dental asst. She was totally amazing, professional and funny  The Dentist was on time, but his mannerism and disposition is totally appalling! I have had tooth pain for two weeks. This was an emergency appointment. He disregarded everything I told him gave me antibiotics and sent me home with no pain meds even though I told him I\\'ve been taking Motrin and it\\'s not working. I also told him I have a trip and didn\\'t want to be in pain on my vacation. All he had to do was extract the tooth or put me on antibiotics and pain meds! I will not be going back to him. Furthermore I asked for a copy of my ins info and he refused to give it to me. I would of paid for the copy!!!\"\\n\"Best dentist I\\'ve ever had, he always makes me feel at ease when he walks in the room, always has a smile on his face and I love his staff they have been great from setting up appointments,working with me finacially and there hygenist\\'s are great I\\'m always in and out pretty quick.\"\\n\"A Horrible  small  dentist office located on nereid, Adepetu Adewale DDS is not professional  at all ,does not take time to look into patients  concerns .Does not move at a professional  pace. Also does  not speak good English . \"\\n\"I\\'m not a fan of going to the dentist,  but Dr Grant made the whole experience comfortable and professional.  Great dentist...\"\\nSaid I needed an oral surgeon.\\n\"I have been going to the dentist for over 45 years on a regular basis.  I have recently become a patient of Dr. Fusco.  Never have I been to a dentist with a more caring attitude and I really believe he is highly qualified.   I have had numerous crowns and fillings over the years and had really gotten to the point of being scared and nervous of dental visits.  His office is the most relaxed atmosphere and after two more crowns and a filling, I am absolutely convinced this is the best dentist I have ever been to!  No waiting for your appointment time, he and his staff are so pleasant and professional and I will never go anywhere else!  My husband and I both are totally confident in his abilities and highly recommend him if you are looking for a great dentist!  I have rated him highly on purpose.  He really is that good!\"\\nDr. Pershing bought my records from my retiring dentist.  I had absolutely no control over this and now Dr. Pershing is demanding that I pay $50 to get my own dental records.  It may be legal but highly unethical and certainly unfair.   Who knows what he will make you pay for - go to another dentist.\\nWonderful dentist! Explains things very well and is willing to go out of his way to see patients for emergency  issues! \\nCaring dentist who is very thorough\\nDr. Salm is great. Very pleasant and friendly. Always receive great care from him.\\nExcellent experience.\\nVery calm and patient dentist.\\nDr. Salm is one of the best and detailed dentists I have ever had. He is gentle and courteous and I have recommended him to all my family and friends.\\nI was very extremely comfortable and loved my smile.\\nAnother great visit with Dr. Salm. Always makes me feel comfortable and makes sure I know what\\'s going on.\\nI\\'m glad I found Dr. Salm when I moved to NYC! I\\'ve been going to Dr. Salm for close to 4 years now and I consistently have a great experience. He is ...\\nDr. Adam Salm is fantastic and very thorough with his cleanings. He is a dentist you look forward to seeing and would definitely recommend him to anyo ...\\nLove Dr. Salm\\'s quiet demeanor and attention to detail. He was gracious and deliberate in execution of my treatment. Happy I found him... no less.\\nDr. Salm is very informative and thorough during his exam consultation.\\nI had a cavity filled with Dr. Salm today. He was very thorough and explained all of my problems to me.\\nDr Salm is very attentive. Makes good recommendations but isn\\'t pushy about additional services.\\n\"Best I have ever seen.  Experts, with  efficient and friendly staff. Latest equipment. \"\\n\"Many years ago, Dr, Rashke saved my son\\'s teeth. He was kind, caring and compassionate. Since then, my husband and I would never consider going to another dentist. All the dentists at Dr. Rashke\\'s office are just like him. I had dental implants done there, and my husband goes there regularly. Dr. Rashke\\'s practice has gotten bigger, but he continues to care about each patiient personally. His office is amazing and relaxing. His staff is wonderful. I guarantee you, if you go to him once, you won\\'t be happy with anyone else. If there were 10 stars I would give that to this office. And no, I am not related to anyone there, just a very satisfied family of patients.\"\\n\"There are much better dentists out there and unless you only need a cleaning, small cavity filled or your dentures adjusted, do not expect top-notch work or any extra time spent to workup a treatment plan or discuss your condition.  Even though the charges are similar to better dentists, it is a \"\"get them in and get them out\"\" business. The receptionist, Valerie, is coarse and barely courteous, although the techs are nice. The waiting area is small, run-down and worn.  In this area, one should expect better dental care.  I have had several root canals and crowns done while in his care and still have quite a bit of pain.  When I asked Dr. Eisner why I still hurt, he shrugged his shoulders and said \"\"I wish I knew\"\".  Not quite the answer you expect.  I later went to an elderly dentist over a weekend due to the pain and he found the problem immediately.  Lots of money and time and pain wasted with Dr. Eisner.  One has to wonder why he makes the long commute from Baltimore to work next to a welfare office.....but I suspect it is because there is no competition from qualified colleagues in the area.  I could give several other examples, but life is short.  I\\'m the most loyal of \"\"customers\"\", but I finally left after several years and never looked back.  Trust me...go somewhere else. \"\\n\"Dr. Bagchi 100% cured my dental anxiety. Until I started seeing her when I was 17, I wanted to die every time I had to go to the dentist. Now, I am 22 and I am very comfortable and trusting with what she thinks needs to be done. I will never go elsewhere. The other staff can be kind of iffy at times, but she is worth it.\"\\nGreat office.  Fantastic hygienist. Definitely recommend \\nGreat office. Friendly staff and so close to home.\\nGreat person and doctor truly a human. You will not be disappointed  \\nMy whole family goes to dr.bolous! I live in staten island and pass up a million dentists on the way to go to him because he\\'s quick and knows what he\\'s doing .. Thank you dr  bolous and his friendly receptionist for all the work you have done for my family. I will continue to tell my family and friends to go to him !\\n\"I honestly could not have picked a better dentist! Such a caring and devoted person. Dr. Powell did not treat me as if I was just another customer, but he actually reached out and asked me how my husband was doing and how life was. He did 3 root canals for me and walked me through the entire process beforehand and answered every question I had. The wait time was short and it was a clean and fun environment.  They worked with me on payment plans and costs and checked in with me to make sure everything was going alright. It was clear that I made the right decision in coming here!\"\\n\"Dr. Powell was extremely kind to myself as well as my family. He allowed my family to enter the room and explained the procedure in detail. He was wonderful at putting my worries at ease and , ill have to say, he didn\\'t hurt at all!!! We love Dr. Powell and will always use him for our root canals!!!\"\\n\"This is an opinion. This man has a serious ego problem.  He did not care about my feelings or my pain.  When I complained about his manner with me, he argued, made excuses, and denied his ill manner.\"\\nI started seeing Dr. Adam Scott when he first opened his practice and I could not be more pleased with the care I have received.  He and his staff are friendly and professional.  I have recommended him to others.\\n\"To put it simply, I have had to go to another dentist to fix what Dr Willis did; made every tooth he touched worse. Pretty disappointed. It\\'s also pretty clear they don\\'t do anything that requires skill. Sends everything out.\"\\nBest ever dentist\\n\"Starting with Genous, the Hodges practice, now including Justin and Adam Hodges, has treated my family for several years.  Their care has been impeccable,  their hygienists are the best, and the office staff is excellent.  They have also taken the same fine care of my referrals. I\\'ve seen a few dentists in my life, and these are my faves. \"\\nExcellent experience seeing it\\'s a dentist.   Highly recommend!!!!!!\\nExcellent Dr\\nDr. Hodges is the BEST dentist in Asheville.  He is so meticulous on the details of his work.  He has done 3 crowns for me and they are perfect!\\nDr Winton is an excellant doctor. \\nLiked this Dr very much . He was caring and his office staff top notch \\nBoth of my boys had their wisdom teeth removed by Dr. Winton. He took the time to explain and answers all of their questions. The day of surgery he made sure they were comfortable. He called me to check on them in the evening. He was available to answers questions on the weekend. I highly recommend Dr. Winton! \\n\"Dr. Winton is a true professional!  He a very, very caring man.  You will not feel rushed.  You will understand everything about the procedrue before anything gets started. My Daughter had her wisdom teeth taken out. Later that day I had to tell her what went on because she didnt remember anything. The days that followed were she had some discomfort but not much.  I would highly recommend Dr. Winton.  The staff are all very nice and very helpful.  The whole office is fantastic.\"\\ni will highly recomment Wilton to everyone. \\n\"Dr. Winton is a true pro. Coming from someone who was terrified to get wisdom teeth removed, Dr. Winton assured me all would be fine. IV sedation was the best decision I could have made. I have no memory of the procedure which is a good thing. Virtually no pain in the days after the surgery and hardly needed the prescribed pain killers. Would not hesitate to recommend to a friend and would never use another oral surgeon except Dr. Winton. Plus, both of his offices are spotless clean and state of the art. He\\'s the man!\"\\nHighly recommend this oral surgeon.\\n\"Simply a great oral surgeon - skilled, informative, no pain, filled me with confidence in his abilities. I would recommend him to anyone.\"\\n\"I am always terrified of dentists, but Dr. Winton and his staff helps to ease your fears and prepare you calmly for the procedure.Dr Winton:-Spends quality time with you, kind bedside manner (hard to find in dr\\'s today)-Explains in detail your condition and the next steps-Personally calls the day after the procedure to check on you-Is available 24 hrs after the procedure\"\\n\"Just had a wonderful experience with Maree who is my hygienist, very professional. Also want to compliment Lauri  who always is very helpful understanding my dental bills and working with the insurance company. Whenever I do need regular dental needs Dr. Haney is fantastic and makes you feel very comfortable. Denise is also very good and as Dr. Haney\\'s asst. She  is truly very professional and also makes the dental experience enjoyable.\\n\\n.\"\\n\"Dr.Winton is not only highly intelligent,honest,knowledgable but compassionate as well. He actually takes as long as you need to explain the treatment with all the various options. I would highly recommend him.\"\\n\"Dr Haney and his staff go the extra mile to take care of you.  I have been going  there for years, and have sent family and friends, because of their excellent service.\"\\n\"Very nice nurses, Immaculate Office - Nothing fancy but state of the art equipment.  Does not cut corners, Made calls to my Dr before surgery (he was a referral)  Details were given expertly, Kind during the process, No swelling - minimal discomfort.  5 STARS I would refer him without hesistation.\"\\nHad a very good experience with my visit to this doctor.\\n\"Waited over 40min, then felt rushed. \"\\nGreat Dentist..I would recommend Dr. Socarda to all my family and friends..\\n\"He did a root canal for me and made me wonder why root canals have bad reputation.  I came in for consultation, he recommended a root canal and offered to do it right then to avoid a 2nd visit.  Kept me informed what was going on through procedure and there was minimal pain.\"\\n\"Dr. Socarda is great! As a patient of Dr.Socarda for over ten years, he always takes the time to explain to me what needs to be done on my teeth to keep them healthy.  I am very happy to have found a dentist who really cares.  I feel  more confident in my self and my smile.\"\\n\"Dr. Socarda told me I had a small cavity.  Then post filling I experience more pain. I\\'m confused and I\"\"m not sure whether I should go back for a visit. \"\\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND Dr. Remm for a root canal.\\n\"I went for a preventative exam and also had bridge work that was loose. At the initial exam he had me make an appt. for a debride cleaning due to more build up. He had me schedule another appt. to address the bridge, at that appt. he took it off and said that I had to have a whole new bridge done (I was very upset because this bridge was only 2 yrs old.) He told me no charge for this appt. and they will work up a quote.\\nAfter thinking about my situation I called my old dentist and asked about my bridge being warrantied. They got me in right away, redid all the xrays at no cost to me, and fixed my bridge, basically by regluing it down. WOW, and I did not need a debride cleaning, my teeth were in pretty good shape per their hygenist! No out of pocket costs to me! I called Dr. Saeks office to let them know and they seemed put out. Then I got a bill for the 2nd office appt., I called and Dr. Saeks said he didn\\'t remember saying no charge for taking my bridge completely off and temp. gluing. I paid the $48, but it\\'s the principal to me that this dentist would have charged me not 100\\'s but thousands of dollars uneccesarily! The rudeness is beyond me. BUYER BEWARE\"\\nHis office is marvelous and his staff is excellent. Very flexible with times and has great professionalism. \\nFantastic dentist. Friendly staff. Highly recommend. \\nBest Dental Office I have ever been to!\\nstaff not good.\\nDr Neil and her staff are excellent! I appreciated the ability to easily find an appointment time.

And when I cried in joy at the smile i thought was gone forever she didnt settle for giving a handshake, she gave me a hug. She smiles and laughed to at my happiness. You could tell she was just as happy as me she could give me back my smile. She is the sweetest most caring person I've met in the dental field and helped me get a loan for the 500$ USD balance i had that has 0% interest if i pay it off in the first year. I never imaged when they told me the extent of the dental work I'd need that that they could make my insurance pay for 2 k of it leaving me with only the cost of two extractions and a cleaning to coer.

Dr. Cook let me know two or three years ago that I was going to have to do something, time enough to upgrade my dental insurance.   Throughout the process he treated me as a partner, occasionally even emailing me after hours to bring up ideas or to see how I was doing.  The work itself was expensive and unpleasant, but the results are fabulous.  And everyone at Dr. Cook's office, from the receptionist to the hygienist to his assistant, has been exceedingly pleasant and professional.  I really can't say enough about Dr. Cook's deep investment in the work he does and in his patients' well-being, and this attitude is contagious in his office.

It was not good enough for him. He got frustrated, left and came back a few minutes later and finished which involved him yelling at me two more times.

The dentist got so upset with him because he would move his head a little (tics from the Tourette\\'s) and didn\\'t keep his mouth wide enough. He fussed at my son, got ugly with him, jerked his mouth open and told him he was too old to be acting this way and that he should be more brave. He then stood up from his chair and told him when he could get his act together he would come back. Then my son busted out crying and then so did I at the sight of him. The Dr came back about 10 minutes later and asked if he was ready now. He began placing the filling and my son, who was by this point scared to move an inch, let out a whimper. The dentist said \"Oh come on man, you know it doesn\\'t hurt. You should be an actor with all that whining, you are really good at it\" and pulled his mouth wider. He finally got the filling done, pushed the button to raise my son\\'s seat and walked out of the room shaking his head. Then my son starts crying again telling me he was sorry he was such a bad boy.

I told them that I didnat need all the extra treatments they wanted to do, I just want my teeth pulled for the advertised price of $89. At that point the office assistant said aOKa. It took the dentist less than 30 seconds to extract each tooth, 3 total. After they were finished I was told they charged my Motheras credit card $944. (Which I have to pay back). They knew the amount I was able to spend and with plenty of opportunity to properly inform me that they werenat going to charge me $89 a tooth but instead charge me $295 a tooth plus the $59 for X-ray (no cleaning as advertised). If I was properly informed I would have not consented to this treatment because at the moment I am unemployed and living with relatives.

My teeth had moved over the course of time to the point that I felt like I needed an adjustment.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the beginning, Dr Goodman takes the time to discuss with you the process you will be going through with clear expectations of what to expect. At each appointment with him, he will review with you how your teeth are adjusting and where he expects changes to take place. I followed his directions as prescribed and wore my liners for the recommended 20 hours a day. Initially, I was turned off by the number of attachments I needed but quickly got over it. There was very little discomfort and the assistants worked closely with me if adjustments were needed to make the liners more comfortable to wear.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first appointment and at the very beginning of treatment, he showed me a video of how my teeth will be changing throughout the course of treatment. The video was such a great incentive to keep wearing the liners! The staff at the office make the frequent office visits very quick and pleasant. It really isn't a huge inconvenience to have a checkup every 4-6 weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I really love about Dr. Goodman is that when he feels the treatment needs to be adjusted, he never hesitates to order new liners after taking new images of how my alignment changed. He's done this twice for me and each time I feel like I'm getting a better degree of adjustment.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm close to completing my treatment and my teeth are better aligned now than they have ever been.
